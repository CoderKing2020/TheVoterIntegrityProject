# Proof of Death
All of our records were crossed referenced directly from the US Social Security Death Index, so confirming on ancestry.com is a confirmaion we have already done.

What we are looking for is extremely credible information like obituaries with places a person has lived to go one step futher than ancestry.com.  

Also - obituaries add a level of humanity to the situation with will help resonnate with a larger audience no matter political affiliation.

Please include links to obituaries.
