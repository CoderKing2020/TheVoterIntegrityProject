# Consolidated List of Suspicious Voter Activity
None of the assets provided under this list were created or primarily contributed by The Voter Integriy Project. We have the desire to provide a consolidated list of resources that are compelling evidence of voter fraud. Everything on this list is considered real, verifiable, and compelling evidence of fraud found during the 2020 Presidential Election. I will share as much sources and citations as possible when including work in the lists below.

### Dr.SHIVA LIVE: MIT PhD Analysis of Michigan Votes Reveals Unfortunate Truth of U.S. Voting Systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztu5Y5obWPk&feature=emb_title

This was a live stream recorded by MIT PhD Dr. Shiva. He and his collegaues cover a statistical analysis of the difference between Michigan's "straight" ticket voting system, vs the vote per candidate.

Their findings show that there is a large descrepency between the number of voters that voted "straight reuplican" and voted for Donald J Trump. They actually showed that the more conservative the precinct, the suspciousness increases. It also shows that Trump was doing better in democractic precinct that he was in strong republican districts.
