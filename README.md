## Deceased Voter Investigations




# Consolidated List of Suspicious Voter Activity
None of the assets provided under this list were created or primarily contributed by The Voter Integriy Project.

We have the desire to provide a consolidated list of resources that are compelling evidence of voter fraud. Everything on this list is considered real, verifiable, and compelling evidence of fraud found during the 2020 Presidential Election.

I will share as much sources and citations as possible when including work in the lists below.

### Dr.SHIVA LIVE: MIT PhD Analysis of Michigan Votes Reveals Unfortunate Truth of U.S. Voting Systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztu5Y5obWPk&feature=emb_title

This was a live stream recorded by MIT PhD Dr. Shiva. He and his collegaues cover a statistical analysis of the difference between Michigan's "straight" ticket voting system, vs the vote per candidate.

Their findings show that there is a large descrepency between the number of voters that voted "straight reuplican" and voted for Donald J Trump. They actually showed that the more conservative the precinct, the suspciousness increases. It also shows that Trump was doing better in democractic precinct that he was in strong republican districts.

### Benford's Law in Russian Elections

https://archive.vn/gCPSG

This link is an archived page from The Gaurdian where they argue that Benford's Law is used to prove fraud in the Russian Election. This type of fraud detection has been used in the 2020 election to identify fraud in certain precincts in swing sates.

### Benford's Law

https://github.com/RocksGarnett/2020_benfords

This is a good repo outlining what Benfords Law is and some visuals to help illustrate how and where Joe Biden violates that law.
